<p>So why is Google still important today? It is estimated that every second, there are 40,000 searches through Google. This means there are 3.5 billion searches a day, and 1.2 trillion searches a year(1). On top of that, as shown below, Google makes up a giant 88.8% of all search engine searches. If this wasnt enough to cement in your mind the importance of Sergey Brin and his work, I would add that Google is at the front of almost every developing form of technology, from self-driving cars to space travel. I would argue that Google may be the single most important company of the modern age, and it is all funded by the astronomical success of the search engine designed by Sergey Brin and Larry Page.</p>
