<p>Sergey was born in the Soviet Union in 1973, with his parents emigrating to the United States when he was 6. Fearing persecution by the Soviet government, his parents felt they would have a better life in the United States. Sergey said in an interview with Mark Malseed for The Google Story that his father, Mikhail Brin, was "forced to abandon his dream of becoming an astronomer even before he reached college"(1). His father went on to become a professor of mathematics at the University of Maryland, and instilled in Sergey a love of mathematics and computing from a young age. Below is a table showing some basic information about Brin's education. </p>
