<p>Sergey was born in the Soviet Union in 1973, with his parents emigrating to the United States when he was 6. Fearing persecution by the Soviet government, his parents felt they would have a better life in the United States. Sergey said in an interview with Mark Malseed for The Google Story that his father, Mikhail Brin, was "forced to abandon his dream of becoming an astronomer even before he reached college"(1). As a result of this, Mikhail Brin decided his son would have a better chance of success in the United States. His father went on to become a professor of mathematics at the University of Maryland, and instilled in Sergey a love of mathematics and computing from a young age. Below is a table showing some basic information about Brin's education. </p>

<p>While being educated at Paint Branch Montessori School, Sergey received extra tuition and help from his father outside of school. This helped to give Sergey a love of mathematics and computing, as well as improving his Russian language skills(2). During Sergey's time at Eleanor Roosevelt Highschool, his father organised a trip for him and 20 students to visit the Soviet Union. Sergey stated to Mark Malseed, "On the second day of the trip, while the group toured a sanatorium in the countryside near Moscow, Brin took his father aside, looked him in the eye and said, 'Thank you for taking us all out of Russia.'"(3). After graduating from Eleanor Roosevelt High School in 1990, Sergey followed in both his fathers and his grandfathers footsteps by going on to study Mathematics with Computer Science at the University of Maryland. In 1993, Sergey was awarded a Bachelors degree from the School of Computer Science in Computer Science and Mathematics with honours(4).</p>

<p>After graduating from the University of Maryland, Sergey went on to being studying for his Phd at Stanford University. It was here where he met Larry Page at an orientation event for new students. The two quickly became friends and, despite disagreeing on most subjects, soon authored a paper together titled "The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine"(5). This would form the basis of the search engine Google that together they would go on to create, with Sergey and Larry creating the now famous algorithm PageRank(6). </p>
