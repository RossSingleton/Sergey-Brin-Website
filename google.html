<p>After meeting Larry Page at Stanford University, Brin and Page would co-author a paper on the anatomy of a large web based search engine. Together, they would go on to create the PageRank algorithm, named after Larry Page, which would form the basis of the search engine Google. "PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites"(1). Although Google uses a combination of algorithms, PageRank was the first and is the most well known(2).</p>
