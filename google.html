<p>After meeting Larry Page at Stanford University, Brin and Page would co-author a paper on the anatomy of a large web based search engine. Together, they would go on to create the PageRank algorithm, named after Larry Page, which would form the basis of the search engine Google. "PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites"(1). Although Google uses a combination of algorithms, PageRank was the first and is the most well known(2). Below is an example of how PageRank works(2).</p>

<p>Since then, Google has become the most popular search engine in the world. However, this is not the limit of what Sergey Brin and the company Google have contributed to the world. As a co-founder of Google, Serger Brin has been a key influence in both Google's in house projects and its aquisitions of other companies. As of 2016 Google specialises "in Internet-related services and products that include online advertising technologies, search, cloud computing, software, and hardware"(3). Google has a line of netbooks, known as Chromebooks, is extremely active in the development of self-driving cars, as well as being at the forefront of Augmented Reality (AR) with their product Google Glass. As well as this, Google has the most popular web browser in the world with Google Chrome(4). Google is also the leading company in the development of the mobile operating system Android, and also has its own range of phones, the Nexus devices.</p>

<p>Perhaps Sergey's greatest contribution to the modern world was the introduction of the idea that a company could be profitable simply from selling advertising space on the website, and later the evolution into user-tailored advertising. With the technological change of one company having access to your searching history as well as your web browser, Google now has the ability to both sell and display targeted advertising, making an advertisement much more valuable. This could be considered one of Sergey's greatest contributions to the modern world.</p>
